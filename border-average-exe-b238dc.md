border-average.exe is an executable file associated with GIMP, an open-source image editing software developed by The GIMP Development Team, specifically linked to version 2.10.12.0. Generally, this file is considered safe and is not classified as a virus or malware, as it is part of the legitimate software package for GIMP, which is widely used for graphic design and photo manipulation tasks. However, like any software, it may occasionally encounter errors or issues, such as crashes or unexpected behavior, which can be attributed to system compatibility, user permissions, or other software conflicts rather than inherent problems with the executable itself. Users should ensure they download GIMP from official sources to avoid any potential risks associated with malicious versions that might disguise themselves under similar filenames.
